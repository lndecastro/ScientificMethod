# Scientific Method for Artificial Intelligence & Data Science

## Welcome

Welcome to **Scientific Method for Artificial Intelligence & Data Science**, a graduate-level course designed to prepare students to conduct **rigorous, reproducible, and ethically grounded research** in AI and Data Science.

This Jupyter Book serves as the primary learning resource for the course. It integrates conceptual foundations, methodological guidance, practical research workflows, and scholarly best practices to support students—particularly those in the **MSCS thesis track**—as they transition from coursework to independent research.

Rather than focusing on specific tools, libraries, or applications, this course emphasizes **how knowledge is produced, validated, and communicated** in AI and Data Science through the lens of the scientific method.

## Why This Course Exists

AI and Data Science research is often mistakenly reduced to:
- Training models
- Tuning hyperparameters
- Maximizing performance metrics

While these activities are part of the research process, they do not, by themselves, constitute **scientific research**.

This course exists to address a critical gap:  
**many students know how to build models, but not how to design, justify, evaluate, and defend research scientifically**.

By the end of this course, students should understand that credible AI/DS research requires:
- Well-formulated research questions
- Methodologically sound experimental design
- Careful evaluation and statistical reasoning
- Reproducibility and transparency
- Ethical awareness and societal responsibility
- Clear scientific communication

---

## Course Orientation

This course is structured as a **scientific apprenticeship**. Each chapter builds on the previous ones, guiding students through the full research lifecycle:

1. Understanding what constitutes science in AI and Data Science  
2. Framing research within ethical, societal, and regulatory contexts  
3. Transforming broad interests into precise research questions  
4. Using the literature as scientific evidence  
5. Designing sound research methodologies  
6. Conducting rigorous experiments and evaluations  
7. Ensuring reproducibility through tooling and pipelines  
8. Iterating responsibly based on preliminary evidence  
9. Writing thesis-quality scientific documents  
10. Communicating and defending research contributions  

The course is cumulative by design: **work produced in early chapters feeds directly into later research artifacts**, including the thesis proposal.

## How to Use This Jupyter Book

Each chapter follows a consistent structure:

- **Purpose** — why the chapter matters scientifically  
- **Learning Objectives** — what you should be able to do after completing it  
- **Core Content** — conceptual and methodological guidance  
- **Key Takeaways** — essential points to retain  
- **Reflection Questions** — prompts for critical thinking  
- **Exercises** — applied research tasks tied to your own project  
- **Further Reading** — recent, peer-reviewed literature  

Students are encouraged to:
- Read actively, not passively
- Take notes tied to their own research ideas
- Revisit chapters as their projects evolve
- Treat exercises as inputs to their thesis work, not standalone assignments

---

## Expectations and Research Mindset

This course assumes a **graduate-level mindset**:

- Curiosity paired with skepticism  
- Precision over speed  
- Transparency over convenience  
- Insight over performance chasing  

You are expected to:
- Justify methodological decisions
- Question assumptions (including your own)
- Document decisions and iterations
- Engage critically with the literature
- Treat ethics and reproducibility as core scientific concerns

There are rarely single “correct” answers in research—only **better or worse justified ones**.

---

## Relationship to Other Programs

This course is **intentionally distinct** from programs on:
- AI Literacy
- Teaching with AI
- Productivity tools or applied AI workflows

Its focus is not on *using* AI, but on **researching AI and Data Science as scientific disciplines**. The skills developed here are foundational for:
- Master’s theses
- Doctoral preparation
- Research-oriented industry roles
- Evidence-based AI system design

---

## What You Will Produce

By progressing through this Jupyter Book, you will develop:

- A clearly defined research problem and question
- A structured and critical literature review
- A defensible research methodology
- A rigorous experimental design
- Preliminary experimental results
- Draft thesis chapters
- A complete research proposal
- A proposal defense presentation

In other words, this course is designed so that **successful completion places you in a strong position to execute your thesis research**.

---

## A Final Note

Scientific research is rarely linear, tidy, or comfortable. It involves uncertainty, revision, and critical self-examination. This course embraces that reality and provides a structured framework to navigate it.

Approach this Jupyter Book not as content to be consumed, but as a **research companion**—one that evolves alongside your work and supports you as you move from student to researcher.
