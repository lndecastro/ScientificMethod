# Chapter 3 — From Problem Area to Research Question

## Purpose

This chapter focuses on one of the most critical and difficult steps in scientific research: **transforming a broad area of interest into a precise, feasible, and researchable question**. In AI and Data Science, many projects fail not because of poor implementation, but because the research problem is ill-defined, overly broad, or misaligned with scientific contribution.

By the end of this chapter, students will understand how to move from general curiosity or application ideas to **well-scoped research questions and hypotheses** that can be addressed rigorously within the constraints of a Master’s-level thesis.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:

- Distinguish between **problem areas, research problems, research questions, and hypotheses**.
- Identify meaningful and researchable problems in AI and Data Science.
- Assess **novelty, feasibility, and relevance** of potential research questions.
- Formulate clear research objectives and hypotheses aligned with the scientific method.
- Scope a research question appropriately for an **MS-level thesis**.
- Align research questions with available data, methods, and evaluation strategies.

## 1. From Interest Areas to Research Problems

Students often begin with broad interests such as:
- “Explainable AI”
- “Bias in machine learning”
- “Large language models”
- “AI in healthcare”

While these areas are important, they are **not research problems**. A research problem must identify:
- A gap, limitation, or unresolved issue
- A context in which the problem manifests
- Why existing approaches are insufficient

A useful heuristic is:  
> *What do we still not understand, measure, explain, or validate in this area?*

---

## 2. Characteristics of a Good Research Problem

A strong AI/DS research problem is:

- **Clear**: precisely stated and unambiguous
- **Focused**: narrow enough to be studied rigorously
- **Grounded**: supported by gaps in the literature
- **Feasible**: solvable with available data, tools, and time
- **Relevant**: scientifically and/or societally meaningful

Problems that are too broad, purely engineering-focused, or lacking empirical grounding often lead to weak scientific contributions.

## 3. Research Questions vs. Objectives vs. Hypotheses

### 3.1 Research Questions
A research question articulates **what you want to understand or explain**.

Examples:
- How does distribution shift affect the fairness of classification models?
- What trade-offs exist between explainability and performance in deep learning models?

Research questions should be **answerable through empirical or experimental methods**.

---

### 3.2 Research Objectives
Objectives describe **what the study aims to accomplish**.

Examples:
- To evaluate model robustness under synthetic distribution shifts
- To compare explainability techniques across model architectures

Objectives are often multiple and operational.

---

### 3.3 Hypotheses
Hypotheses are **testable statements** predicting outcomes.

Examples:
- Models trained with domain adaptation will exhibit reduced fairness degradation under distribution shift.
- Post-hoc explainability methods will show lower fidelity for deeper architectures.

Not all AI/DS research requires formal hypotheses, but **testability and falsifiability remain essential**.

---

## 4. Novelty and Contribution in AI/DS Research

Novelty does not require inventing entirely new algorithms. Contributions may include:

- New empirical evidence
- Improved experimental design
- Better evaluation protocols
- Identification of failure modes
- Replication and validation under new conditions
- Application of known methods to underexplored domains

A common pitfall is overestimating novelty based solely on performance improvements.

---

## 5. Feasibility and Scope for MS-Level Research

A Master’s thesis has practical constraints:
- Limited time
- Limited computational resources
- Limited access to proprietary data

A feasible research question should:
- Be answerable within one academic year
- Rely on accessible datasets
- Avoid excessive parameter or dataset explosion
- Allow incremental progress

Overly ambitious questions often lead to incomplete or superficial research.

---

## 6. Aligning Questions with Data and Methods

Research questions must be compatible with:
- Available datasets (size, quality, labels)
- Appropriate methodologies (experimental, empirical, algorithmic)
- Evaluation metrics
- Ethical and legal constraints

A mismatch between question and data is a frequent cause of failed studies.

---

## 7. Advisor Alignment and Research Planning

Successful research is collaborative. Early alignment with an advisor helps ensure:
- Methodological soundness
- Appropriate scope
- Feasible expectations
- Intellectual coherence

A well-formulated research question facilitates productive advisor feedback and committee evaluation.

---

## Key Takeaways

- Broad interests must be transformed into **specific research problems**.
- Strong research questions are clear, focused, feasible, and grounded in literature.
- Distinguishing questions, objectives, and hypotheses improves scientific clarity.
- Novelty in AI/DS often comes from **methodology and insight**, not only new models.
- Proper scoping is essential for MS-level research success.

## Reflection Questions

1. What distinguishes a research problem from an application idea in AI/DS?
2. How can overly broad research questions undermine scientific rigor?
3. In what ways can empirical validation constitute a meaningful contribution?
4. How do feasibility constraints shape good research questions?
5. How early should advisor alignment occur, and why?

## Exercises

### Exercise 1 — Problem Refinement
Select a broad AI/DS topic and iteratively refine it into:
- A research problem
- One primary research question
- Two supporting objectives

Explain each refinement step.

---

### Exercise 2 — Hypothesis Formulation
For a chosen research question, propose:
- One testable hypothesis
- One alternative hypothesis
- An outline of how the hypothesis could be falsified

---

### Exercise 3 — Feasibility Assessment
Evaluate your proposed research question against:
- Available datasets
- Required computational resources
- Time constraints
- Ethical considerations

Summarize potential risks and mitigation strategies.

## What’s Next

In **Chapter 4**, we will focus on **the literature review as scientific evidence**, emphasizing how to synthesize prior work to justify research gaps and methodological choices.
